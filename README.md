Published under the GNU GPLv3 license.

This program is used to help learn or teach music theory. It contains a selectable root note, followed by a selection of either flat or sharp accidentals, then chords or scales to choose from. The selection is displayed in a table, in sheet music notation, and in on a piano.
More chords and scales will be added in time, as well as other instruments on which to display the selected notes on.
Contributions are welcome and appreciated, as well as comments, concerns, and experiences.
