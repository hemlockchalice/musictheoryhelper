Hemlock Chalice Music Theory Helper, 2025

Published under the GNU GPLv3 license.

This program is used to help learn or teach music theory. It contains a selectable root note, followed by a selection of either flat or sharp accidentals, then chords or scales to choose from. The selection is displayed in a table, in sheet music notation, and on a piano.
More chords and scales will be added in time, as well as other instruments on which to display the selected notes on.
This program also contains a frequency calculator and a sine generator; more tools will be added as well.
Contributions are welcome and appreciated, as well as comments, concerns, and experiences.

Future additions and changes:
- bass clef notation to the sheet music aide
- switchable octaves to the sheet music aide to show chords or scales in different positions
- a plethora of new chords, especially uncommon and complex chords
- custom color coding
- new instrument aides other than just the piano
- a timing & rhythm tab with a customizable sequencer to teach and learn timing, especially odd time signature concepts as well as percussion tablature
- additions and improvements to the Help and Glossary sections
